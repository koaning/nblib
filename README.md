The idea is pretty simple. Run this: 

```python
uv run --with cookiecutter cookiecutter https://github.com/koaning/nblib
```

And this will start a new project that can be written completely from a Jupyter notebook. Start a new project and run the `make install` command to get started with everything. 

Once everything is ready to be exported you can run the `make build` command to export the notebooks to a python package.
